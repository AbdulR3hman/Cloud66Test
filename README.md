##A solution to a company called Cloud 66;


The problem can be found attached with this repo, however simply put, is a script to 
find substring character positions in another string without using the actually string library such as include?


To run it, 

ruby SubStringMatcher.rb Maintext subText

e.g. 


######ruby SubStringMatcher.rb "text is long" "text"
would result in;
######Match No. 1 start @ position: 1
