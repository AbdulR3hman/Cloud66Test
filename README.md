A solution to a company called Cloud 66;


The problem can be found attached with this repo, however simply put, is a script to 
find substring character positions in another string without using the actually string library such as include?


To run it, 

ruby SubStringMatcher.rb Maintext subText

e.g. 


ruby SubStringMatcher.rb "text is long" "text"
would result in;
Match No. 1 start @ position is 1
